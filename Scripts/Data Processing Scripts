Data Processing Script Explanation and Steps
In this project, I manually used Power Query to merge 17 annual Excel spreadsheets into a single data source for efficiency. The remaining pre-cleaning and formatting steps were carried out in Excel. The final processed file was then uploaded to Google BigQuery where the analyses were performed using SQL.
